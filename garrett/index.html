                                    I got to gain expereince in a lot of different bits of education. A lot of what
                                    I did revolved around:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Creating lesson plans with my host teacher</li>

                                    While my time spent in my internship wasn't related to my computer science degree,
                                    I thoroughly enjoyed getting to spend time with a lot of individuals who all have
                                    their own ways of thinking. My teaching experience led to me gaining a better 
                                    understanding of how people can think diffferently and how to shape what I'm 
                                    trying to communicate to help them best understand what I mean.
